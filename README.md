The Delphi IDE Colorizer (DIC) is a plugin which allows to **skin the look and feel of the workspace** of the RAD Studio IDE and Appmethod.

`Dear users,`

`We would like to inform you that I have decided to archive the Delphi-IDE-Colorizer on GitHub. Working on this project has been a challenging but rewarding experience, as it allowed me to delve deeper into the internals of Rad Studio. However, with Rad Studio now offering out-of-the-box styling options, there is no longer a need for this project to continue.`

`Thank you for your support and understanding.`

`Rodrigo.`
